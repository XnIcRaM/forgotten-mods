Forgotten-mods
==============

Forgotten Mods is a fan-made chrome-extension/bookmarklet that enhances poe.trade experience by augmenting more details to it's search results.

Features
==============
1. Displays whether the mod is a **prefix/suffix** (in red or blue).
2. Displays the **Tier Level** of the Mod.
3. Displays the **Name of the affix**, neat huh. This is activated on mouse hover.
4. All these are ran seamlessly when you do a search on poe.trade (using Chrome Extension).
5. Auto-generate Want-to-Buy private message. This is done by adding a WTB link after the PM link. Clicking WTB will prompt you a generated message which you can copy and then paste in-game. IGN, Item-name and Price included!

Runs as a Chrome Extension or a simple browser bookmark. When you do a search with poe.trade, the tool runs automatically (or click your bookmark) and you'll see some valuable information as you can see in the screenshot.
